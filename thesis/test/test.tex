\section{Example Section}
This is an example section. Please see it as such. Lorem ipsum. 
\begin{gather}\label{eq:binary_to_uint}
A = a_l a_{l-1} \dots a_2 a_1,\;\; a = \left\{0, 1\right\} \; \forall a \in A \nonumber \\
x = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot 2^{i-1}
\end{gather}
As you can clearly see in \ref{eq:binary_to_uint}, lorem ipsum a very very very big lot. Really. Believe me. Tom always says it is that way and he showed me using reveal.ja, so he is to be trusted.
